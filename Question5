Assessment:
perform a linear mixed effects analysis of the relationship between response variable gauss and the predictor variable cats. 
After fitting four models, I selected a linear mixed model with variable time, cats (no interaction) as fixed effects and 
by-id as a random effect to response variable gauss. The output of the summary of the model shows the p-value for cats’ coefficients 
are 2*10^(-16), indicates that I can reject the hull hypothesis that cats’ coefficient is equal to zero. 
In other words, the predictor variable cats’ level changes are related to changes in the response variable gauss. 
To be precise, coefficients of the model predicts that when the cats’ level change from one to two, response variable gauss 
increase 3.999 units and change from two to three, response variable gauss increase  4 units. SE of the predictors cats are 
quite small, small standard errors indicate better precision of the coefficients. However, the residual plot shows I am most 
likely dealing with some kind of categorical data and need to use different models. I fitted a generalized linear mixed model,
the output shows the problem still exists. Maybe I need to try different class models, such as logistic models. 
Sorry I ran out my time.
